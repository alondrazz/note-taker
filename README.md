# Note Taker Starter Code

## I had to make a functional note taker application using Express.js back end. I had to connect the front end and back hand and then deploy the entire application to heroku.

## In order to get this application you will need to copy my github repo and then clone it to your computer.

## I had a lot of help from my tutors, learning assistents and I tried the new learning assistant AI that vanderbilt provided for us, as well as looking back at my class.
